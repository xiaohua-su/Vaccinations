## Data
The data that was used in to create the model was taken from [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/page/211/). In order to access the data from DrivenData, you'll need to create an account and sign up for the competition. The data is also available on this github in my [data folder](https://github.com/xiaohua-su/Predicting_H1N1_Vaccination/tree/main/data). This data was derived from the CDC’s. It contains basic information on the individual such as their education levels, `race`, `gender`, `age_group` and their opinions on the topic of H1N1 and Flu vaccine such effectiveness. Sensitive Information about the individual such as what region they’re located in, employment industry and occupation were already masked in this dataset.
